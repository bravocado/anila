### Note
This is a heavy starter and completely personal.
Consider it, if you want to use Anila.

#### Documentation
Up until now, there's no online documentation. Run `grunt` and check your `dist/docs/`.

## Dependecies
- SASS [SASS documentation](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html)
- Libsass [install](http://libsass.org/)
- Node [install](http://nodejs.org/)


## How to use it?
- install gem `[sudo] gem install anila`
- now you can play with it. `anila new [project/path]`
- By default you will have Compass project. You can switch to libsass compiler by running `anila new [project/path] --libsass`.


## To Do List
- Moving to SASS 3.3 (release on different version)
- Using Block Element Modifier for CSS classes [reference](http://www.sitepoint.com/css-sass-styleguide/) (release on different version)
