# Forms
<h3 class="subheader">We set out to create an easy, powerful and versatile form layout system. A combination of form styles and the Foundation grid means you can do almost anything.</h3>

## Building Forms With HTML

Ceating a form in Foundation is designed to be easy but extremely flexible. Forms are built with a combination of standard form elements, as well as the Grid (rows and columns).

Form elements in Foundation are styled based on their type attribute rather than a class, and can be sized in a couple of ways:

* You can size inputs using column sizes, like `.lg-6`, `.sm-6`.
* You can create row elements inside your form and use columns for the form, including inputs, labels and more. Rows inside a form inherit some special padding to even up input spacing.

This is an example form we've created that is laid out using the grid:

<div class="row">
  <div class="lg-12 col">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>

		{{> examples_form_basic}}
  </div>

  <div class="lg-12 col">
    <h4>HTML</h4>

		{{> examples_form_basic_rendered}}
  </div>
</div>
