# Units

We are using REM as a default. But if you want to support IE8 and add a fallback, you can set a rem fallback in conditional.scss:

```scss
$rem-fallback: true !default;
```

<br>
If you're thinking about using our unit mixin, we also cover it! Simply :

```scss
@include unit($property, $value...);
```
<br>
SCSS :

```scss
@include unit(padding, 0px 10px);
```

<br>
CSS :
```css
padding: 5px 20px;
padding: 0.27778rem 1.11111rem;
```
