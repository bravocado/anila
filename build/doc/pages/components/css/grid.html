# Grid CSS

<h3 class="subheader">Create powerful multi-device layouts quickly and easily with the default 12-column, nest-able from Foundation grid. If you're familiar with grid systems, you'll feel right at home. If not, you'll learn quickly.</h3>

***

<h3>Basic</h3>

Start by adding an element with a class of `row`. This will create a horizontal block to contain vertical columns. Then add divs with a `col` class within that row. You will notice the naming rules isn't same like Foundation, i've combined it with Bootstrap naming rules because really familiar to use and more simple. Don't forget to specify the widths of each column with the sm-#, md-#, and lg-# classes.

Code for small screens first, and larger devices will inherit those styles. Customize for larger screens as necessary.
