# Grid

<h3 class="subheader">Create powerful multi-device layouts quickly and easily with the default 12-column, nest-able from Foundation grid. If you're familiar with grid systems, you'll feel right at home. If not, you'll learn quickly.</h3>

***

<h3>Basic</h3>

Start by adding an element with a class of `row`. This will create a horizontal block to contain vertical columns. Then add divs with a `col` class within that row. You will notice the naming rules isn't same like Foundation, i've combined it with Bootstrap naming rules because really familiar to use and more simple. Don't forget to specify the widths of each column with the sm-#, md-#, and lg-# classes.

**Foundation is mobile-first**. Code for small screens first, and larger devices will inherit those styles. Customize for larger screens as necessary.

### Small Grid

Small grids expand to large screens easier than large grids cram into small screens.

### Medium Grid

Medium sized screens will inherit styles from small, unless you specify a different layout, using the medium grid classes.

<h3>Advanced</h3>

You can nest the grids indefinitely, though at a certain point it will get absurd.

### Offsets

Move blocks up to 11 columns to the right by using classes like `.lg-offset-1` and `.sm-offset-3`.

### Centered Columns

Center your columns by adding a class of `sm-centered` to your `column`. Large will inherit small centering by default, but you can also center solely on large by applying a `lg-centered` class. To uncenter on large screens use `large-uncentered`.

### Source Ordering

Using these source ordering classes, you can shift columns around between our breakpoints. This means if you place sub-navigation below main content on small displays, you have the option to position the sub-navigation on either the left or right of the page for large displays. Prefix push/pull with the size of the device you want to apply the styles to. `sm-pull-#`, `medium-push-#`, `large-push-#` is the syntax you'll use.

## Customize with Sass

Customizing the grid is easy with the Sass variables provided in the `_settings.scss` file.

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{> examples_grid_variables}}

<h3>Basic</h3>

You can use the `grid-row()` and `grid-column()` mixins to create your own rows and columns with semantic markup, like so:

<div class="row">
  <div class="lg-6 col">
    <h4>SCSS</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```scss
.custom-row-class {
  @include grid-row();
  .custom-column-class {
    @include grid-column(12);
  }
}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="lg-6 col">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{> examples_grid_row_mixin}}
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

You can further customize your grid columns using the provided options in the `grid-column()` mixin:

##### Row Mixin Options

{{> examples_grid_row_options}}

##### Column Mixin Options

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{> examples_grid_column_mixin}}

***

##### Sass Errors?

If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import this file:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```scss
@import "anila/grid/logic";
```
{{/markdown}}
